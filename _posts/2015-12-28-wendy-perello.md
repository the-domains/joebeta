Wendy Perello

Wendy has managed marketing and advertising teams and projects for large clients, big agencies and boutique shops. She's launched new products and her own consulting agency, managed brands through crises, re-organized divisions and kept even the most complex project on track and on budget.

On the client-side, after starting her career with direct marketing powerhouse, MBNA America, Wendy has held senior marketing positions with American Express, Citibank and 1.800.Flowers. Starting her own firm, Wendy began a consulting career, helping big shops like DraftFCB and boutique firms like Thinktopia solve problems for big brands.

At the agency, Wendy is best described as a chief client officer, helping the planning, creative, media and production teams deliver the most compelling solutions to clients. On the brand side, Wendy has been most successful bringing the CMO's vision to life, through the management of agencies, goals and objectives, budgets and personalities.

Wendy's "free" time is spent raising two (excellent) boys and serving the Harlem community where her family lives supporting children's programs and the public school system as a volunteer.
